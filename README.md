## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

For Mbed OS, the kit must be in DAPLink mode. Refer the **KitProg3 User Guide** (found in the Documentation tab in the [Cypress Programming Solutions](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) web page) for details of how to put the Pioneer Kit into DAPLINK mode.

## Software Setup

- Install a terminal emulator such as [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) if you don't have any.

- Install the *ARP'ing* network utility:
  - [Windows](https://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/arp-ping.php)
  - [macOS](http://macappstore.org/arping/)
  - On Linux, use the `sudo apt install arping` command. Most of the Ubuntu OS distributions have it natively available.

This example requires the [Device Configurator Tool](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig), which is installed as part of [ModusToolbox v2.1](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/modustoolbox-software-archives).

## Import the Code Example using Mbed CLI Tool

Mbed CLI commands are used to import the code example and compile. See [Working with Mbed CLI web page](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/tools/working-with-mbed-cli.html).

```
mbed import https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-wlan-offload-discard-packet
```

It first clones the code example repository from GitHub, and then deploys all the libraries. If you wish to perform the *deploy* process manually, follow the below commands::

Clone the GitHub code example repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-wlan-offload-discard-packet && cd mbed-os-example-wlan-offload-discard-packet
```

Deploy the dependent libraries. The library files are identified with *.lib* extension.

```
mbed deploy
```

Set the current directory as *root*:

```
mbed new .
```

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open *mbed_app.json* and modify the `nsapi.default-wifi-ssid`, `nsapi.default-wifi-password`, and `nsapi.default-wifi-security` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect to.

3. Ensure that your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you configured in Step 2.

4. Program the board.

    ```
    mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash --sterm
    ```

    For example, to build for the target CY8CPROTO_062_4343W with GCC_ARM toolchain, use the following command:

    ```
    mbed compile -m CY8CPROTO_062_4343W -t GCC_ARM --flash --sterm
    ```

    **Note:** With the `--sterm` option, Mbed CLI opens a new  terminal with 9600-8N1 as the setting after programming completes. Do not use this option if you want to connect using another serial terminal application such as PuTTY or Tera Term.

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Verify that the application startup log shows the following fields:

    ```

6. The application puts the host MCU into deep sleep power mode by suspending the network stack. The network stack is resumed when there is any Tx/Rx activity detected in the WLAN driver interface. When the host resumes, the following console logs can be seen. This shows the statistics of the SDIO bus transaction.

    ```

    ```

7. To verify the discard filter, send a `ping` request from your PC to the target kit. Because the `ping` packet (ICMP type) is configured to be discarded by the WLAN, the ping request will time out and the packet will get tossed by the WLAN. 

   ```
   $ ping 192.168.0.109
   Pinging 192.168.0.109 with 32 bytes of data:
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.

   Ping statistics for 192.168.0.109:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),
   ```

   Now, send an ARP request packet (0x806) to the kit. Because any WLAN packets other than ICMP packet are allowed to reach the host, the host MCU will wake up and will generate an ARP response with the valid host MAC address.

      ```
      $ arp-ping.exe 192.168.0.109

           Minimum = 1114.330ms, Maximum = 1116.832ms, Average = 1115.095ms
      ```

   To send the `arp-ping` command every 'x' seconds, use the following command:

      ```
      $ arp-ping -i X <IP address of the target kit>
      ```
      where `i` denotes the interval; ARP request packets will be sent every `X` seconds.

8. To allow ICMP packets to reach the host MCU, remove the default discard filter configuration. Do the following:

    1. Open *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>/design.modus* using ModusToolbox Device Configurator tool.
    2. Go to the **CYW943012WKWBG** tab > **Wi-Fi** (CY8CKIT_062S2_43012 kit, for example).
    3. Under the **Packet Filters** section, remove the filter configuration by clearing the **Enable Filter Configuration 0** option:

       **Figure 1. Remove the Discard Filter**

       ![](images/remove_discard_filter.png)

    4. Click **File** > **Save**. This will re-generate the sources for the LPA configuration.

9. Re-program the application using the command from Step 4.  Verify that the host MCU now wakes up for the `ping` request packets.

   ```
   $ ping 192.168.0.109
 
   Pinging 192.168.0.109 with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from 192.168.0.109: bytes=32 time=411ms TTL=255
   Reply from 192.168.0.109: bytes=32 time=361ms TTL=255
   Reply from 192.168.0.109: bytes=32 time=435ms TTL=255
   Reply from 192.168.0.109: bytes=32 time=176ms TTL=255
 
   Ping statistics for 192.168.0.109:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 176ms, Maximum = 435ms, Average = 345ms
   ```

   This verifies the working of discard packet filter offload.

**Note:**

- This application is configured to discard only the ICMP packet type. This means that any WLAN packet other than ICMP type can wake the host from deep sleep. In a highly congested network (where multiple clients connected to the Access Point), it is expected that the PSoC 6 MCU would wake up more frequently due to broadcast and multicast traffic from the network peer devices. In such case, you may wish to add packet filters to the PSoC 6 MCU. The packet filters helps the application to filter out unwanted network packets reaching the host MCU. For more details, see [Packet Filter Offload application](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-wlan-offload-packet-filter). Alternatively, to simply test this application, ensure only the target kit has associated with the AP to prevent unwanted network traffic. See [Configure Packet Filters](#configure-packet-filters) to learn how the discard filter is configured in this application.

- This code example disables the default device configuration provided in *mbed-os\targets\TARGET_Cypress\TARGET_PSOC6\TARGET\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* with the one provided in *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>*. The custom configuration disables the Phase-locked Loop (PLL), disables the HF clock to unused peripherals like audio/USB, and configures the Buck regulator instead of Low Dropout (LDO) regulator to power the PSoC 6 MCU device. This configuration reduces the current consumed by the PSoC 6 MCU device in active state with a small increase in deep sleep current. Enable the peripherals using Device Configurator if you are using them. 

- This application does not try to associate to the AP if it is disconnected from the network. In that case, reset the kit to connect to the AP.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

Follow the steps from [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide#page=23) to export the Mbed OS code example and import it into ModusToolbox IDE for programming and debugging.

Mbed OS also supports debugging using any IDE that supports GDB. We recommend the user to go through [ARM Mbed's documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/debug-test/index.html) on the debugging steps.

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

A Packet Filter filters out unwanted network packets from reaching the host MCU (PSoC 6 MCU) and waking it. This helps the host to stay in deep sleep for longer periods of time. WLAN packets can be filtered based on the port (in the application layer in the OSI model), protocol (transport layer), or Ether Type (network layer).

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers, protocol numbers, or Ether type for WLAN packets. See the [IANA Protocols Registry](https://www.iana.org/protocols) for information on protocol numbers.

**Figure 2. Packet Filters Supported (based on a standard IP Stack)**

![](images/pkt_filter_osi_layers.png)

For more details on the implementation, see the [Low Power Assistant Reference Manual](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/lpa/lpa_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#group_lpa_p2_packet_filter).

This application does the following when the kit is powered up:

1. Initializes Wi-Fi as a STA (Station) interface.

2. Initializes the Offload Manager (OLM) with the configuration present in the *GeneratedSources* folder inside *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>*, where the source code for the feature is generated by the Device Configurator tool in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox. The OLM will be initialized based on the *GeneratedSources* configuration.

3. Connects to the AP with the Wi-Fi credentials in the *mbed_app.json* file.

### Configure Packet Filters

Use the Cypress Device Configurator tool to configure packet filters and the host MCU wake pin. By default, Mbed OS is shipped with a *design.modus* file that can be used to configure the kit's peripherals from scratch per application requirement. The *design.modus* file can be opened only with the Device Configurator tool.

For this discard packet filter demo, a pre-configured *design.modus* file is provided for each target *TARGET_\<kit>*. We recommend that you go through the following steps to understand how a packet filter is configured. It provides useful information on how to access the *design.modus* file and how to configure a discard packet filter using the ModusToolbox Device Configurator tool.

**Note:** The steps in this section are already handled with this application. They are provided only for informational purposes.

1. Open Device Configurator from the ModusToolbox installation directory: *<mtb_install_dir>\ModusToolbox\tools_2.x\device-configurator*.

2. Select **File** > **Open** and then open the *design.modus* file in the example directory for the respective kit, in *<application_folder>/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>/design.modus*.

   If the *design.modus* file does not open, and the error message *No device support library path provided* appears, point to the *psoc6pdl* folder inside the *mbed-os* directory. The path should look like: *mbed-os-example-wlan-offload-discard-packet\mbed-os\targets\TARGET_Cypress\TARGET_PSOC6\psoc6pdl*.

   **Figure 3. Error Opening design.modus File**

   ![](images/error_no_device_support.png)

   **Figure 4. Set Path to psoc6pdl**

   ![](images/point_to_devicesupport.png)

3. On the **PSoC6 MCU Pins** tab of the Device Configurator tool, do the following:

    - **CY8CKIT_062_WIFI_BT**
        1. Enable the Host wake pin **P2[7]** and name it *CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE*.
        2. In the **Parameters** pane, change the following:
            - **Drive Mode:** Analog High-Z. Input buffer off.
            - **Initial Drive State:** High(1).
            - **Interrupt Trigger Type:** Rising Edge.
        ![](images/configurator_pins_tab_wifi_bt.png)

    - **CY8CKIT_062S2_43012**
        1. Enable the Host wake pin **P4[1]** and name it *CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE*.
        2. In the **Parameters** pane, change the following.
            - **Drive Mode:** Analog High-Z. Input buffer off.
            - **Initial Drive State:** High(1).
            - **Interrupt Trigger Type:** Rising Edge.
        ![](images/configurator_pins_tab_43012.png)

    - **CY8CPROTO_062_4343W**
        1. Enable the Host wake pin **P0[4]** and name it *CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE*.
        2. In the **Parameters** pane, change the following.
            - **Drive Mode:** Analog High-Z. Input buffer off.
            - **Initial Drive State:** High(1).
            - **Interrupt Trigger Type:** Rising Edge.
        ![](images/configurator_pins_tab.png)

4. Go to the tab for the connectivity device and configure the fields as follows. This configuration is applicable to all [supported kits](#supported-kits). Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the Discard Packet filter configuration for CY8CKIT_062S2_43012.
   
     1. Enable host wake configuration and set **Host Device Interrupt Pin** to **CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE**.

     2. Under the **Packet Filters** menu, select only the **Enable Filter Configuration 0** and configure it as follows:

    **Figure 5. WiFi Configuration**

    ![](images/add_discard_icmp_filter.png)

    **Figure 6. Discard Filter Configuration**

    ![](images/discard_filter_configuration.png)

    This will set a discard packet filter for ICMP packets which is a *ping* packet.

7. Select **File** > **Save**. The generated source files *cycfg_connectivity_wifi.c* and *cycfg_connectivity_wifi.h* will be available under the *GeneratedSource* folder present in the same location where the *design.modus* file was opened.
